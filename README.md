# Small Celeste Mod Collection

A repository collecting all my smaller or map-specific code mods for Celeste.

Here is the list:
- Aroxon Berry - a "no-midair-jump" winged strawberry, requires defining `ghost_aroxon_berry` and `aroxon_berry` in Sprites.xml to give it graphics
- Badeline Hair Dye ([Reverse Card skin mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/251787)) - gives Madeline's hair color to Badeline
- [Bloom Command](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53703) - a mod that adds a `bloom` console command similar to the vanilla `lighting` command
- [Crabbing Antidote](https://gamebanana.com/mods/480169) - a small mod that aims to fill missing C-side slots in save files to prevent file select from crashing, after a failed "Crab Sides" April Fools 2023 mod crabbed them :crab:
- [Crabinator](https://gamebanana.com/mods/504182) - A mod that crabs your game by replacing all textures with :crab:, made for April Fools 2024
- Cabob Berry Swap ([Frozen Heights](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150681)) - changes the GUI strawberry icon (now possible with [Maddie's Helping Hand](https://github.com/EverestAPI/ModResources/wiki/Helping-Hand-Extra-Features#reskinning-strawberries-in-menus))
- [Celsius Fixer](https://gamebanana.com/mods/489392) - makes [Celsius by 0x0ade](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PJzLFAC_d2ZCBh3Va3h2JNLreCxhkTiU) playable on Everest Core
- [Display Message Command](https://gamebanana.com/mods/421935) - a mod that provides a simple command that displays arbitrary text on-screen, in the same style as the strawberry counter
- Donker Berry Swap ([Solaris](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150559)) - same as the above but for another map :sweat_smile:
- Donker Cassette Song Swap - a mod that allows the B-side cassette song of a hard-coded campaign to override the A-side cassette song, to have different cassette songs for each
- Donker Jellies ([Solaris](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150559)) - provides a Frozen Jelly, that doesn't fall down when not held and falls slower when held, and a Reverse Jelly, that inverts the vertical inputs of the player and the throw direction. Both are available in [Maddie's Helping Hand](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53687).
- [Event Mode](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53674) - a tiny mod that puts Celeste in a hidden "event mode"
- [Full Clear Stamp](https://gamebanana.com/mods/34279) - a mod adding a stamp on a save file for full-clearing a campaign
- [Golden Bird in Journal](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53662) - a mod turning the bird in your journal golden when you full clear Farewell
- [IronSmeltery's Campaign](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150697) - various custom entities made for IronSmeltery's campaign
- Life On The Moon - entities made for a map by MÃ¼n that did not end up coming out, including curved boosters :sweat_smile:
- Madeline Brown Hair - just... colors Madeline's one-dash hair brown
- Magi Customizable Chapter 1 Ending ([Sunset Mountain](https://gamebanana.com/mods/150752)) - a trigger for the bonfire cutscene at the end of Chapter 1, with customizable dialogue
- Nolz Custom Hair Color - yet another mod that changes Madeline's hair colors
- [Pro Banana Skin](https://gamebanana.com/mods/251806) - a mod that adds a toggle for the skin and implements color-grade-based dash colors... having a specific mod for that (and any of the 5 hair color mods in here) was made unnecessary by [Skin Mod Helper](https://gamebanana.com/mods/166543), though :stuck_out_tongue:
- Reverse Fancy Text ([Hebrew Translation](https://gamebanana.com/mods/391870), [Celeste Arabic](https://gamebanana.com/mods/495421)) - a mod that modifies dialogue text and memorial text to be revealed from right to left (kind of)
- [Safe Respawn Crumble](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53746) - a helper containing a single entity (Safe Respawn Crumble) extracted from Spring Collab
- Seeker CH6 Cutscene - a cutscene triggered with an event trigger with event = `seekerinthedark_ch6_ending`, that looks like the "level up" cutscene at the end of chapter 6, except Badeline vanishes instead of giving Madeline a second dash
- Shirb Sleep Teleport - exposes a small `SleepTeleportTo` method, that allows teleporting with Lua Cutscenes with the "wake up" animation (which was useful back when Lua Cutscenes didn't support enums that well :sweat_smile:)
- Wolfy One Dash Hair Color Mod ([Fox Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/320696)) - yet another mod that changes Madeline's hair colors (this time, only the 1-dash hair color)
